# House Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to estimate the house price of different available houses.

The dataset consists of synthetic data. This allowed us to incorporate many properties different real world datasets have. Please keep in mind that not each of the listed houses might be constructed like described in the real world (e.g. 20 sqm with 3 bathrooms), but still look out for other outliers in the data (like mentioned in the first lecture) and otherwise general logic still applies to this dataset (e.g. a house that was built thousands of years ago, but has the same properties as a newer one, may not make sense)!

<h4>The Feature Description is as follows:</h4>

Bedrooms - number of bedrooms <br>
Bathrooms - number of bathrooms  <br>
SquareFootageHouse - the square footage of the house in square meters  <br>
Location - whether the house is urban, rural or suburban  <br>
Age - the age of the house, all houses were built in the last 100 years  <br>
PoolQuality - the quality of the pool, if it is 'None' then there is no pool  <br>
HasPhotovoltaics - if the house has photovoltaics  <br>
HeatingType - the heating type of the house  <br>
HasFiberglass - if the house has the possibility of a fiberglass connection  <br>
IsFurnished - if the home is furnished  <br>
DateSinceForSale - the date the house was put on the market  <br>
HouseColor - the color of the house  <br>
PreviousOwnerName - the first name of the previous owner  <br>

KitchensQuality - quality of the kitchen(s) <br>
BathroomsQuality - quality of bathroom(s) <br>
BedroomsQuality - quality of the bedroom(s) <br>
LivingRoomsQuality - quality of the living room(s) <br>
SquareFootageGarden - the square footage of the garden in square meters  <br>

Window_model_names - the name of the window model  <br>
Price - the price of the house in thousands of euros  <br>
